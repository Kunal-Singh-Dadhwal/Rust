# RUST 

This repo is for learning rust 

Integer datatypes:- 

unsigned :- u8,16,32,64
signed :- i8,16,32,64


Mutuable vs immutable variables 

Variables in rust are immutable by default cant be changed

so "mut" is used to make them mutable


```rust
fn main(){
  println!("Hello World!");
}
```


```rust
 println!("The number stored in num is {}", num);

// this is for format printing like %d in C
 ```

String literal of two types &str and String
